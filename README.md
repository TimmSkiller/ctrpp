Nintendo 3DS Library in C++

This is going to be me, learning C++ while making a library for Nintendo 3DS Types. I'm planning on adding support for every major type.
Crypto is going to be a challenge, as I've never really touched crypto in languages other than C#. Can't guarantee that this will ever turn into something useful.
